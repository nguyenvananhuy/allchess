## What is Chess?
Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid, traditionally with 32 pieces (16 per player). Originating in India around the 6th century as *Chaturanga*, it has evolved into countless forms worldwide. This repository catalogs both the traditional game and its many variants.
